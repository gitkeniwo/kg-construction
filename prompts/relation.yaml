# chunk-level relation extraction
chunk-relation-extraction-basic: |
  
  Your task is to extract relation triplets from a chunk of text that is part of a larger document. You will be provided with:

  1. The current chunk of text
  2. A list of relation types to look for
  3. A list of known entities 
  
  Your goal is to check the text, and find which relations can be derived from the text.
  
  Please follow these steps:
  
  1. Extract all relations tuples between entities within this chunk. Your output format is in python list, shown as below:
  [("entity 1", "entity 2", "relation1", "relation-type"),
  ("entity 3", "entity 4", "relation2", "relation-type"),
  ...]
  
  2. Identify the subject and object entity (put in position 1 and 2)
  3. Specify the relation in position and relation type in position 4
  4. Answer directly without using introductory phrases and without any other remarks or comments. Just the extracted relations tuples.
  5. No duplicates or semantically similar relations should be included. Try to keep the most informative relations.
  
  one example like:
  
  [("Scrooge", "Bob Cratchit", "employer", "Character-Relationship"),
  ("Scrooge", "Marley", "business partner", "Character-Relationship"),
  ...]
  
  Current Chunk Text:
  {current_chunk}
  
  Relation types:
  {relation_types}
  
  Known Entities:
  {global_entities}

relation-extraction-with-summary: |
  
  Your task is to extract relations from a chunk of text that is part of a larger document. You will be provided with:

  1. A brief summary of the entire document
  2. The current chunk of text
  3. Information about the chunk's position in the document
  4. A list of known entities from previous chunks (if applicable)
  
  Your goal is to:
  1. Identify entities and extract relations between these entities
  2. Note any potential coreferences to entities or information outside this chunk provided with global entity list
  
  Please follow these steps:
  
  1. Extract all relations between entities within this chunk. For each relation:
    a. Output in the format ("entity 1", "entity 2", "relation", "confidence-score"), each on a new line
    b. Identify the subject and object entity (put in position 1 and 2)
    c. Specify the relation (put in position 3)
    d. Provide a confidence score ("high", "medium", "low")
  2. Answer directly without using introductory phrases and without any other remarks or comments.
  3. Identify any potential coreferences or references to entities that might be defined in other parts of the document or outside the current chunk.
  4. If any entities match those in the provided list of known entities, use the existing identifiers for consistency.
    
  Document Summary:
  {doc_summary}
  
  Chunk Metadata:
  - Chunk Number: [Insert chunk number]
  - Total Chunks: [Insert total number of chunks]
  - Previous Chunk Topic (if known): [Insert brief description of previous chunk's main topic]
  - Next Chunk Topic (if known): [Insert brief description of next chunk's main topic]
  
  Known Global Entities:
  {global_entities}
  
  Current Chunk Text:
  {current_chunk}
  

assign-entity-types: |

  You are provided with one entity extracted from a document.
  
  You are also provided with a list of possible entity types.
  
  Your task is to assign the correct entity type to each entity in the list. 
  Remember, for the answer, you can only choose one entity type from the provided entity types!
  
  For example, with the input:
    Scrooge
  
  Your answer should be:
    Person
  
  For another example, with the input:
    London
  
  Your answer should be:
    Location
  
  Answer directly without using introductory phrases and without any other remarks or comments.
  
  The entity extracted from the text is:
    {entity}
  
  The selectable entity types are:
    {entity_types}




# final round: merge local entities
# for example: "scrooge's nephew" is first identified as an entity,
relation-consolidation:
  system: > 
    You are an expert in natural language processing and information extraction. 
    Your task is to consolidate and reconcile relations extracted from multiple chunks of a long document.
  human: |
    You will be provided with:
  
    1. A brief summary of the entire document
    2. A list of global entities identified across all chunks
    3. Relations extracted from individual chunks
  
    Your goal is to:
    1. Combine relations across chunks
    2. Resolve coreferences
    3. Identify long-range dependencies
    4. Ensure consistency in the final set of relations
  
    Please follow these steps:
  
    1. Review the document summary and global entity list to understand the overall context.
    2. For each relation provided:
       a. Check if the entities involved are coreferent with any global entities.
       b. If so, update the relation to use the global entity identifier.
       c. If not, add the new entity to the global entity list.
    3. Identify and merge duplicate relations, keeping only the most informative version.
    4. Look for potential long-range dependencies by:
       a. Identifying relations with similar subjects or objects across different chunks.
       b. Checking for transitive relations (e.g., if A relates to B, and B relates to C, consider if A might relate to C).
    5. Resolve any conflicting relations by:
       a. Prioritizing relations from more reliable or recent parts of the document.
       b. Noting any unresolvable conflicts for human review.
  
    6. Provide a final list of consolidated relations, each including:
       - Subject entity (with global identifier)
       - Relation type
       - Object entity (with global identifier)
       - Confidence score (if available)
       - Source chunk(s) where the relation was found
  
    7. Highlight any relations that span multiple chunks or involve long-range dependencies.
  
    8. Note any ambiguities or areas where human verification might be needed.
  
    Document Summary:
    [Insert brief summary of the entire document]
  
    Global Entity List:
    [Insert list of global entities with their identifiers]
  
    Extracted Relations:
    [Insert list of relations extracted from individual chunks, including the chunk identifier for each]
  
    Please provide your consolidated and reconciled list of relations based on this information.
